### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing an associate degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College.

Right now I am working on: [Schedule Creator](https://github.com/EmmanuelR21/schedule-creator) **_This project has taken a back seat as the school semester has started, but is still in development_**

I'm currently learning from the following sources:
- [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/):
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in C ~ [**My Repository**](https://github.com/EmmanuelR21/advent-of-code):
- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)
<!--
**EmmanuelR21/EmmanuelR21** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
